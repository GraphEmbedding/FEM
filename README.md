Based on the survey result, the effect of proposed system/method is promising. For instance, 72.73\% of participants believed the new system, along with the formula understanding method, can provided useful information (Q3), and 43.75\% believed the proposed method can help them better understand the math-content in a paper ``most of the time" (another 31.25\% reported it is helpful ``about half of the time"), and no one (0\%) thought the system `almost never'' provided the useful information. There were 45.45\% participants gave positive responses (``most of the time'') to the question ``Does the content of the information meet your needs?''(Q2), while 24.24\% were negative (``some of the time''). Again, no one (0\%) thought the system ``almost never'' met the information need. From a system usability perspective (Q6), 70.23\% of participants believed the formula highlight function in PDF and OER recommendation functions were easy or very easy to use. Overall, 63.63\% of participants reported that the system and formula understanding method can be helpful or very helpful to assist them to better understand the target paper (Q7), only 12.12\% reported the new functions are not helpful, and others were neutral.
